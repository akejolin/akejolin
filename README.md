### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

From the beginning, self-learned but later on a University degree in a mix of project management, tech, design and finance. I started my professional web engineer career 1999 and have since then, worked in many different kinds of sets. I have run my own business, worked in many different teams, several companies, both small and big. I have had different roles. I have been a web engineer, engineering manager and today I work as an Engineering Manager at one of the biggest podcast suppliers in the world.
I have many times contributed to open source projects. I have seen new technologies arise, but I have also seen many of them being replaced by another. But one thing that has been persistent during these years, is my passion for tech.

Preferable tech domains: Node, AWS and Typescript but also leadership, agile coach and delivery management.

## Projects

### Asteroids

Here is fun game (Asteroids) I have created. The game was built in `Typescript` with `NextJS`, `React` and `Redux` and uses the `canvas` to render the graphics. Enjoy!

### Screen saver
I made a screen saver that takes a snap shot of an emoji and creates particles as builing blocks. With some iterations of an array I managed to create some cool effects moving around the particles.
